The IFROF platform uses advanced algorithms to analyze factory data, including production records, quality certifications, and past inspection reports. This deep analysis reduces reliance on initial human inspection, saving time and money. For instance, AI can compare images of actual products against required standards with high precision, detecting any deviations instantly [1]. It also contributes to predicting potential risks in the supply chain, ensuring goods arrive with the agreed-upon quality. This approach guarantees that IFROF-verified factories adhere to the highest global quality standards.",
