Deployment Issue Analysis
==========================

Problem:
--------
The logs show the OLD deployment (with the ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT error) is still running.
The new fix hasn't been deployed yet by Railway.

Evidence:
---------
- Logs timestamp: Jan 21 2026 13:43:55 - 13:44:58
- Our fix was pushed at approximately 13:46
- Railway hasn't triggered a new deployment yet

The error is still at line 4686 in dist/index.js which is from the OLD build.

Solution:
---------
Need to wait for Railway to detect the new commit and trigger a new deployment.
Railway should automatically deploy when it detects the new commit on main branch.

Alternative: Manually trigger redeploy from Railway dashboard.
